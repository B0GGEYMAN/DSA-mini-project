This C++ program implements a Simple Banking System using a queue data structure to manage customer service operations in a First In, First Out (FIFO) manner. It allows users to add customers (enqueue), serve customers (dequeue), and display the queue through a menu-driven interface. Each customer has a unique ID and name, and memory is dynamically allocated for each new entry. The program ensures that the first customer added is served first, and when the queue is empty, appropriate messages are displayed. The implementation is efficient for real-time customer service scenarios, and it can be enhanced with file handling for data persistence and C++ STL queue usage to optimize memory management.
